# Random-Password-Generator

This code uses the string module, which provides strings with letters, digits and punctuation, and the random module, which provides random number generator functions. The generate_password function generates a password by selecting random characters from chars and concatenating them. The default password length is 16 characters, but you can change it by passing a different number to the generate_password function.
